## CIP Rationale

Crossbell is an open platfrom that needs to iterate and grow. CIPs should describe every primary changes, so CIPs can be viewed as a complete historical record of how Corssbell has grown and evolved. For new implementations, CIPs should provide concise technical specification and help community to better understand and assess their rationale.


## EIP Types

There are two types of EIP:

- A **Standards Track EIP** describes primary changes of Crossbell that affects most or all Crossbell implementations, including protocol changes, application changes and changes in nework configuartions.
  Furthermore, Standards Track EIPs can be broken down into the following categories:
  - **Protocol**: includes improvements and modifications in protocols, mostly in the form of smart contracts modifications and additions.
  - **Networking**: includes modifications in network configuarations, such asâ€”a change to the block gas rules and a modification of consensus mechanism.
  - **Application** launches of new applications. 
- A **Meta EIP** include procedures, guidelines, changes to the decision-making process.
